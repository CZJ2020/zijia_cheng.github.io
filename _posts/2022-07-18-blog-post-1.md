Recently I have been working on a project that involving dealing with pretty complicated crystal structures and BZs. Having tired of working out bulk BZ and surface BZ for each crystal, I wrote a python script to do it for any structures. The script is surprisingly simple, and detailed code can found [here](https://github.com/Zijia-Cheng/DrawBZ). By the time I posted this blog, the project has been starred by 14 people. Glad that people find it useful!
