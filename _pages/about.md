## About Me

<img align="Left" src="../images/cat_in_the_lab.jpg" width="200px" style="padding-right: 10px">

I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Physics at Princeton University, working under the guidance of <a href="https://phy.princeton.edu/people/m-zahid-hasan">M.Zahid.Hasan</a> on the study of topological quantum materials. My research primarily utilizes Angle-resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES), nonlinear optics, and theoretical models to investigate the complex electronic structures of novel topological materials, including Kagome metals, Weyl semimetals, exciton insulators, and Kondo lattices. My goal is to uncover new quantum phenomena within these materials.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I am passionate about developing quantitative machine learning models for applications in equity research. During my summer internship in 2024 at HAP Capital, I developed high-Sharpe, low-drawdown overnight trading strategies for equity index futures and fill rate models for US equities. In my spare time, I delve into creating alphas for forecasting high/mid frequency US stock returns and utilizing them in my own trading strategies. In 2025, I will embark on a new journey as a quantitative researcher at a proprietary trading firm.
