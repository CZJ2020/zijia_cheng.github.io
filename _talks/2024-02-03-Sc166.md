Kagome metals with charge density wave (CDW) order exhibit a broad spectrum of intriguing quantum phenomena. The recent discovery of the novel kagome CDW compound ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ has spurred significant interest. However, understanding the interplay between CDW and the bulk electronic structure has been obscured
by a profusion of surface states and terminations in this quantum material. Here, we employ photoemission spectroscopy and potassium dosing to elucidate the complete bulk band structure of ScV$_6$Sn$_6$, revealing multiple van Hove singularities near the Fermi level. We surprisingly discover a robust spin-polarized topological Dirac surface resonance state at the M point within the twofold van Hove singularities. Assisted by first-principles calculations, the temperature dependence of the kz-resolved angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy spectrum provides unequivocal evidence for the proposed $\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3} \times 3 $ charge order over other candidates. Our work not only enhances the understanding of the CDW-dependent bulk and surface states in ScV$_6$Sn$_6$, but also establishes an essential foundation for potential manipulation of the CDW order in kagome materials.
